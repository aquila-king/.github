#  Case Study — Platform Engineering Microservices CI/CD System

##  Project Summary

This project demonstrates a **production-inspired platform engineering architecture** that enables teams to build, ship, and deploy microservices using a **centralized reusable CI/CD framework**.

The platform was designed to solve a common scaling challenge:

 **How do multiple teams deploy independent microservices while maintaining standardized CI/CD and governance?**

### The solution leverages:

- Jenkins with **Shared Library architecture**
- Docker Hub for **container distribution**
- Amazon EKS for **Kubernetes orchestration**
- GitHub organization with **team-based ownership**
- Kubernetes namespace isolation for **multi-service tenancy**

- ## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many growing engineering teams:

- CI/CD pipelines become duplicated across repositories  
- Teams deploy services inconsistently  
- Governance becomes difficult  
- Blast radius increases when changes are centralized incorrectly  

The goal was to design a platform-engineering-style solution that provides:

- ✅ Standardized pipelines  
- ✅ Team autonomy  
- ✅ Secure multi-service deployment  
- ✅ Scalable onboarding of new services

- ##  Solution Architecture

The platform introduces a **central Jenkins Shared Library** that encapsulates CI/CD logic while allowing each microservice repository to remain lightweight.

##  Platform Design Decisions

### 1️GitHub Organization Governance

####  Teams

| Team | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| order-service | Owns order domain |
| payment-service | Owns payment domain |
| platform | Owns CI/CD & infrastructure |

## Impact

- Clear ownership boundaries  
- Controlled repository access  
- Reduced deployment conflicts

- ## Shared Library CI/CD Model

Instead of duplicated Jenkinsfiles, all pipeline logic lives inside a **reusable function**:

### `deployMicroservice()` Pipeline Capabilities

- Git checkout  
- Maven build & test  
- Docker image build  
- Docker push  
- Kubernetes deployment  
- Rolling update verification  

### Impact

- Eliminates duplicated pipelines  
- Enforces governance automatically  
- Enables fast onboarding of new services

- ## 🛡️ Namespace-Based Kubernetes Isolation

Each service runs in its **own namespace**:

| Service | Namespace |
|---------|-----------|
| Auth    | auth-namespace |
| Order   | order-namespace |
| Payment | payment-namespace |

###  Impact

- Fault isolation  
- Independent scaling  
- Security boundaries  
- Supports multi-tenant cluster design

- ## 📦 Repository Design Pattern

Each microservice repository is intentionally **minimal**:

.
├── Dockerfile
├── Jenkinsfile
├── k8-deployment.yaml
├── k8-service.yaml
├── pom.xml
└── source

### Minimal Jenkinsfile

groovy
@Library('shared-lib') _
deployMicroservice(...)

### Impact

- Developers focus only on **application logic**, not pipeline complexity.

## Container Strategy

Each service is packaged as a **Docker image** and pushed to Docker Hub.

**Example:**
bash
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/order-service:1.0.0 .
docker push your-dockerhub-username/order-service:1.0.0

FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

## Deployment Strategy

### Kubernetes Resources

- **Deployment**: Replicated pods  
- **Service**: LoadBalancer  
- **Rolling updates**: Zero-downtime deployments  
- **Rollout verification**: Health checks and pod status monitoring

kubectl rollout status deployment/<service>

## Security & Governance

- IAM credentials stored securely in Jenkins  
- Namespace isolation for each service  
- Team-based repository permissions  
- No secrets committed to code  
- Rolling deployments reduce downtime risk

## Key Platform Engineering Outcomes

### Technical Outcomes

- Centralized CI/CD governance  
-  Microservice team autonomy  
-  Reusable pipeline architecture  
-  Kubernetes multi-tenant deployment model  
-  Zero-downtime rolling updates  
-  Reduced pipeline duplication

### Organizational Outcomes

- Faster onboarding of new services  
- Reduced operational overhead  
- Clear ownership boundaries  
- Improved deployment reliability

## Challenges & Learnings

### Challenge 1
**Deployment inconsistencies across services**  
**Solution:** Shared library standardization  

### Challenge 2
**Pipeline duplication and maintenance overhead**  
**Solution:** Reusable CI/CD abstraction  

### Challenge 3
**Microservice blast radius in shared clusters**  
**Solution:** Namespace-based isolation

## Future Improvements

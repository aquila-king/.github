# 🚀 Case Study — Platform Engineering Microservices CI/CD System

## 📌 Project Summary

This project demonstrates a **production-inspired platform engineering architecture** that enables teams to build, ship, and deploy microservices using a **centralized reusable CI/CD framework**.

The platform was designed to solve a common scaling challenge:

👉 **How do multiple teams deploy independent microservices while maintaining standardized CI/CD and governance?**

### The solution leverages:

- Jenkins with **Shared Library architecture**
- Docker Hub for **container distribution**
- Amazon EKS for **Kubernetes orchestration**
- GitHub organization with **team-based ownership**
- Kubernetes namespace isolation for **multi-service tenancy**
